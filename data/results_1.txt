list: 1
1: {"answer": "1"} (This is equivalent to G | D)
2: {"answer": "3"}
3: {"answer": ["2475_8", "795_10", "b503_16"]}
4: {"answer": []} (empty list since there are no satisfying assignments)
5: {"answer": 0} 

There are no paths of length 4 in this graph. The longest possible path is of length 2 ('A' - 'D' - 'E' or 'A' - 'E' - 'D').
6: {"answer": ["D-E-F", "D-E-A-C-F"]}
7: {"answer": "1"}
8: {"answer": "No"}
9: {"answer": "55"}
10: {"answer": "72"}
11: {"answer": "4"}
12: {"answer": [["E", "A", "B"], ["E", "A", "D"], ["E", "A", "E"]]}
13: {"answer": [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]}
14: {"answer": "34345"}

16: {"answer": "6 + 9 - 3 + 6"}
17: {"answer": "2 8 - 3 7 / +"}
18: {"answer": "Cannot"} (The question is not clear enough to determine what variables are involved and what the truth value requirements are)
19: {"answer": 16}
20: {"answer": "163"}
